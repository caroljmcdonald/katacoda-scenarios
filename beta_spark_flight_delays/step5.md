Apache Spark GraphX made it possible to run graph algorithms within Spark, GraphFrames integrates GraphX and DataFrames and makes it possible to perform Graph pattern queries without moving data to a specialized graph database.

GraphFrames integrate graph algorithms and graph queries, enabling optimizations across graph and Spark SQL queries, without requiring data to be moved to specialized graph databases.

This notebook will help you get started using Apache Spark GraphFrames Graph Algorithms and Graph Queries with MapR Database

1. To run this exercise, click on the black Zeppelin tab on the right, scroll to the top, click on the blue Zeppelin icon. 
2. This should take you to a Zeppelin page with a list of notebooks.
3. Open and the FlightDelay5SQLGraphFrames notebook. ✈️
4. Follow the Notebook lab instructions. Click on the READY > to run the Spark code paragraphs. 

## Summary
GraphFrames provides a scalable and easy way to query and process large graph datasets, which can be used to solve many types of analysis problems. In this chapter, we gave an overview of the GraphFrames graph processing APIs. We encourage you to try out GraphFrames in more depth on some of your own projects.

All of the components of the use case we just discussed can run on the same cluster with the MapR Data Platform
